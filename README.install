MAKE CHANGES IN THE TOP-LEVEL MAKEFILE

CALL MAKE FROM THE TOP LEVEL

I have a weakness for complex, multilevel makefiles.  Therefore, the
makefiles included here are complex and multilevel.  Always run make from
the top-level directory.  Try 'make help' for a listing of possible
targets (the only one left out is randstr: compile it with make randstr).
All the important variables are defined in the top-level makefile, and
most of the make targets will crash and burn if they do not find the
variables that they are looking for.

The good part of this is that except for the datfiles tree, the
sub-makefiles are all very simple.  All the programs have rules of
the form: program: program.o, with the appropriate link command.
The only target safe to call in individual directories is clean.

The makefiles for the datfiles subdirectory are complex in an attempt to
avoid distributing any more data than needed.  The offensive files are
distributed in unrotated format; the make files have to rotate these
files before strfiling them.  The make clean routine has to be able to
delete the rotated files without touching the unrotated ones.

Pretty much everything is configurable in the top-level makefile, and it
mostly has pretty decent comments telling you what it is that you're
configuring.  Read and change it as necessary.
